As we learned in the previous SQL unit, there are 4 main _data manipulation keywords_: 

- `SELECT` for getting data from the specified table
- `INSERT` for inserting data into the specified table
- `UPDATE` for updating existing data from the specified table
- `DELETE` for deleting data from an existing table

More often these 4 concepts are recognized with the _CRUD_ acronym. 

The _CRUD_ acronym is represented in the following table:

| CRUD | SQL Data Manipulation Language (DML) |
|------------|------------------------------------|
| **C**reate | equals to the _INSERT_ SQL keyword |
| **R**ead   | equals to the _SELECT_ SQL keyword |
| **U**pdate | equals to the _UPDATE_ SQL keyword |
| **D**elete | equals to the _DELETE_ SQL keyword |


In the following sections, we are going to create a `guitars_collection` database together with its table and begin to manipulate the data with the _INSERT_ keyword.

But first, complete the first challenge!
