As you have may experienced, SQL is a pretty straight forward language.

In the first unit, we executed basic __data manipulation__ commands, specifically the `SELECT * FROM table_name;` statement. 

This SQL statement can be executed inside the terminal with the `mysql` interactive shell and statements can be _sourced_ from a file with the `source file-name.sql` command as well. 

### Use semicolons

It's very important to remember that the use of `;` semicolons whenever a SQL statement ends is part of the language syntax.

### Query operators

The `SELECT column_name FROM table_name;` statement can be complemented with the __query operators__ which indicate comparisons, similarities or even regular expression patterns. 

### Getting help

Remember that you can __get SQL help__ by executing the `help contents;` inside the `mysql>` shell.
