### Data Definition Language (DDL)

The keywords that let us _CREATE_, _DROP_ (remove), _SHOW_, _ALTER_ and in general, __manipulate databases and tables__ are commonly associated with the DDL term.

For example, when we created the `guitars_collection` database or schema in the previous section, we determined the name of the computer's memory space where our guitar data is going to be stored.

The `guitars_collection` database will hold _tables_ which at the same time, are going to be defined with column names with the datatypes that each table column must allow to be saved.

### Data Manipulation Language (DML)

It is important not to confuse the DDL keywords with the DML keywords.

_DML_ applies only to the group of 4 keywords (the _CRUD_ keywords) that __directly manipulate database data__.

For example, in the SQL language, the _SELECT_, _INSERT_, _UPDATE_ and _DELETE_ keywords, and its correspondent clauses and operators.
