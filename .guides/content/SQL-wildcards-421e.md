The SQL `LIKE` operator is used in a `WHERE` clause to search for a __specified pattern in a column__.

In order to look for patterns, __SQL wildcards__ must be used. 

### SQL wildcards:

A wildcard character can be used to substitute any other character(s) in a string:

|Wildcard	| Description|
|----------|-----------|
|`%`	|A substitute for zero or more characters|
|`_`	|A substitute for a single character|
|`[charlist]`	|Sets and ranges of characters to match|
|`[^charlist]` or `[!charlist]`	|Matches only a character NOT specified within the brackets|

Experiment with SQL the `%` and `_` wildcards in the next section and complete the challenge afterwards.
